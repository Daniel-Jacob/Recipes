  Recipesss is a recipe application which allows users to search for general recipes and recipes by ingredient. A general recipe is returned if any field in the recipe matches the query. A recipe by ingredient is returned if the query matches the ingredients of a given recipe. 
  
Users can see the returned recipes as images or as titles. A user can add and remove recipes to their favorites list and get basic information about a recipe. This basic information includes the title, image, ingredients and attributes of a recipe. 

In order to access the stored favorites on a different device authentication is required. Recipesss supports google, facebook and E-mail authentication. If a user does not want to authenticate then he or she can continue as a local user, and save their recipes locally. These are a few examples of screens of the application
