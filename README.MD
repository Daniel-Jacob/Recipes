Dutch people spend 2.5 billion euros per annum wasting food (nu.nl). Food waste has at least two negative effects. First, food waste is expensive, since with the waste of food ‘new’ food will be bought faster and more often. Second, food waste is bad for the environment. By reducing food waste the total co2 emissions could be decreased.
These are important reasons to minimize the waste of food. Recipes4you would like to make a contribution to this challenge.
